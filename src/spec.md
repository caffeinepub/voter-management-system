# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the missing main navigation menu that disappeared after Version 15 deployment.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore navigation menu in frontend/src/App.tsx displaying all six menu items (Dashboard, Add Voter, Voter List, Label Printing, Task Management, Analytics)
- Verify navigation menu JSX elements are present and not hidden by CSS or conditional rendering
- Ensure menu is visible on both mobile and desktop views
- Maintain existing header with logout button functionality

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see and use the main navigation menu to access all sections of the application (Dashboard, Add Voter, Voter List, Label Printing, Task Management, and Analytics) on both mobile and desktop devices.
