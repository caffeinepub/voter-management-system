  "summary": "The diff demonstrates successful restoration of the main navigation menu in App.tsx with all six required menu items for both mobile and desktop views. The navigation includes proper routing, conditional styling for active states, responsive design with hamburger menu for mobile, and maintains the dark blue (#002080) header. All requirements appear to be fully implemented.",

    {
      "description": "Implementation of mobile menu toggle state management using React useState hook and hamburger icon (Menu/X from lucide-react)",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states as a non-goal: 'Redesigning the navigation menu layout or styling'. The addition of hamburger menu toggle functionality with state management and icon components was not requested in the requirements.",

      "description": "Implementation of active route highlighting with conditional styling (bg-white text-[#002080] for active, hover states for inactive)",
      "reason": "The requirements focus on restoring visibility and functionality of the navigation menu, but do not specify implementing active route highlighting or hover state styling. This is an enhancement beyond the restoration scope.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest constraints specify to 'Keep the header with Voter Management System title and logout button visible and functional' but do not request changing the header positioning to sticky. This is a styling enhancement not mentioned in requirements.",
