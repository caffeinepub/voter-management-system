  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to frontend/src/App.tsx which includes authentication flow management with detailed stage tracking, 30-second timeout, and error handling. However, the specific changes to frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts (the primary file mentioned in REQ-85 and REQ-86) are not visible in the truncated diff summary. The diff references hooks like useGetCallerUserProfile.ts which mention 'type-safe property access with fallbacks for backward compatibility with the current useActor return type', suggesting useActor changes may have occurred but are not shown.",

      "id": "REQ-85",
      "requirement": "Fix the 'Detected both agent and agentOptions passed to createActor' error in the useActor hook (frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts) by ensuring that only the agent parameter is passed to createActor",
      "reason": "The diff does not include frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts in the modified files list. Without seeing changes to this specific file, there is no evidence that the conflicting agent/agentOptions configuration was fixed.",

      "id": "REQ-86",
      "requirement": "Add defensive error handling to the useActor hook (frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts) to catch actor initialization failures and return clear error states",
      "reason": "The diff does not show frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts modifications. While frontend/src/hooks/useGetCallerUserProfile.ts mentions 'enhanced error handling that includes actor initialization errors', this is in a different hook and does not demonstrate that useActor itself has defensive error handling.",
