  "summary": "The implementation successfully makes all voter fields optional except Name and Voter ID in both frontend and backend. The backend Voter type has been updated with optional fields, the addVoter function accepts null values, and the frontend VoterEntryForm removes required validation from all fields except Name and Voter ID. However, a migration file was created despite the explicit non-goal stating no migration file is needed.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states in non-goals: 'Creating a migration file (not needed for making fields optional)'. The diff shows a new migration.mo file was added and imported in backend/main.mo with 'import Migration \"migration\";' and '(with migration = Migration.run)', contradicting the non-goals constraint.",
